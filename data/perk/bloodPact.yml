  It's as if a latent part of yourself has awakened. You feel like you can reach out beyond yourself
  for assistance.

  When you or the Obsession are injured, you both see each other's auras.

  After completing a healing action on the Obsession, or having the Obsession complete a healing
  action on you, you both gain a **7%** {{status:speed|Haste}} status effect for **[[6/8/10]]
  seconds**.

  Reduces the odds of being the Obsession.

  If you are the Obsession, this perk deactivates.
