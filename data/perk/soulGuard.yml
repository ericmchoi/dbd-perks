  You have been through immense hardship and you're stronger for it.

  Gain the {{status:endurance|Endurance}} status effect for **[[4/6/8]] seconds** after being healed
  or having recovered from the dying state. During this time, any damage that would put you in the
  dying state will instead apply {{status:deepWound|Deep Wounds}}. You have **20 seconds** to
  *Mend* yourself. If you take any damage while affect by {{status:deepWound|Deep Wounds}}, or if
  the time ends, you are immediately put into the dying state.

  While cursed by a hex, you can fully recover from the dying state.
