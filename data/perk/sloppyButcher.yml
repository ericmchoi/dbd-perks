  You know where to hit to make them bleed.

  Wounds inflicted by successful *basic attacks* cause the {{status:mangled|Mangled}} and
  {{status:bleeding|Hemorrhage}} status effects.

  {{status:bleeding|Hemorrhage}} **[[slightly/moderately/considerably]]** increases the Survivor's
  bleeding frequency.

  {{status:bleeding|Hemorrhage}} and {{status:mangled|Mangled}} effects caused by *Sloppy Butcher*
  are removed once the survivor is fully healed.
flavor: |-
  "It's in its sadistic nature. There is no swift kill as it delights in the obscene spectacle of
  our agonizing suffering."
