  The trauma caused by your brutal attacks makes crying for help painfully difficult.

  Survivors put into the dying state by your basic attacks are not revealed to other Survivors when
  they are standing outside of a **[[32/24/16]] meter** range.

  Survivors put into the dying state by your basic attacks crawl **50% slower** for **15 seconds**.

  During this time, Survivors are affected by the {{status:vision|Blindness}} status effect.
