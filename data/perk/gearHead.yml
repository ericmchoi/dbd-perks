  You've got an ear for well-oiled gears.

  After hitting a Survivor **2** times with your *basic attack*, *Gearhead* activates for
  **[[20/25/30]] seconds**.

  While *Gearhead* is active, each time a Survivor completes a Good Skill Check while repairing, the
  generator will be revealed by a yellow aura for as long as it is being repaired.
