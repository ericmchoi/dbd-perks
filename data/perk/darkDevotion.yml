  The display of your Powers creates a whirlwind of panic that spreads throughout the land.

  You become __obsessed__ with one Survivor.

  Hitting the Obsession with a *basic attack* transfers your Terror Radius to the Obsession for
  **[[20/25/30]] seconds**, and sets its radius to **32 meters**. You are granted the
  {{status:undetectable|Undetectable}} status effect for the duration.

  The Survivor with the transferred Terror Radius is also considered to be the "inside the Terror
  Radius" for other purposes.

  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
