  You become __obsessed__ with one Survivor.

  You lurk in the shadows, eliminating your victims one by one. When your Obsession is hooked,
  *Furtive Chase* receives a token, up to a maximum of **[[2/3/4]] tokens**.

  Each token decreases your Terror Radius by **4 meters** while in a chase.

  When a Survivor rescues the Obsession from a hook, the rescuer becomes the Obsession. You lose all
  your tokens if the Obsession is sacrificed or killed.

  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
