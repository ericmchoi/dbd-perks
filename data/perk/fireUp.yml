  The increased pressure of losing your prey fills you with anger and gives you unsuspected
  motivation.
  
  Each time the Survivors complete repairs on a generator, *Fire Up* grows in power.
  - For each generator completed, gain a **[[3/3.5/4]]%** stackable buff that grants a speed bonus
  to picking up, dropping, vaulting, damaging generators, and breaking pallets and breakables for
  the remainder of the trial.
