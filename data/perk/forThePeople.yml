  You risk life and injury for others.

  *For the People* is only active while at full health.

  Press the *Active Ability* button while healing another Survivor without a med kit to instantly
  heal them from dying to injured, or from injured to healthy.

  You become injured and receive the {{status:broken|Broken}} status effect for **[[110/100/90]]
  seconds**.

  You become the Obsession.

  Equipping this perk __decreases__ your chances to be The Killer's Obsession at the start of the
  trial.
