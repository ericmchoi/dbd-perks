  When you have healed other Survivors for the equivalent of one health state, *Second Wind*
  activates. If you are already afflicted by the {{status:broken|Broken}} status effect, *Second
  Wind* does not activate.

  While *Second Wind* is activated, the next time you are unhooked or you unhook yourself, you are
  affected by the {{status:broken|Broken}} status effect. After a total duration of **[[34/32/30]]
  seconds**, *Second Wind* automatically heals you from injured to healthy.

  *Second Wind* deactivates once you become healthy or if you are put into the dying state before
  *Second Wind* successfully triggers. You lose the {{status:broken|Broken}} status effect.
