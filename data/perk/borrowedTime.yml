  You are fuelled by unexpected energy when saving an ally from a hook within The Killer's Terror
  Radius.

  After unhooking a Survivor within The Killer's Terror Radius, they gain the
  {{status:endurance|Endurance}} status effect for **15 seconds**. Any damage taken during that time
  that would put the unhooked Survivor into the dying state will instead apply the
  {{status:deepWound|Deep Wound}} status effect. The Survivor has **[[10/15/20]] seconds** to Mend
  themselves.

  If the unhooked Survivor takes any damage while affected by {{status:deepWound|Deep Wound}}, or if
  the {{status:deepWound|Deep Wound}} timer ends, the unhooked Survivor is immediately put into the
  dying state.
