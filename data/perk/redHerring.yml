  You've noticed that people pay attention to whatever makes the loudest noise.

  After repairing a generator for at least **3 seconds**, it will be highlighted to you with a
  yellow aura. The generator stays highlighted until it is fully repaired, or you repair a new
  generator, or enter a locker.

  Entering any locker will trigger a loud noise indicator for The Killer at the highlighted
  generator's location.
  - *Red Herring* can only be triggered once every **[[100/80/60]] seconds**.
