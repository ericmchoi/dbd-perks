  Those whose lives are intertwined in darkness are destined to suffer together.

  When a Survivor heals another Survivor for one health state at least **32 meters** away from the
  Killer, the Survivor performing the healing action will scream, revealing their location and
  activating *Deathbound* for the next **60 seconds**.
  
  During that time, the Survivor will suffer from the {{status:oblivious|Oblivious}} status effect
  when further than **[[16/12/8]] meters** away from the healed Survivor.
