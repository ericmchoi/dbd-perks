  You start the trial with **3 Tokens**.

  When your aura would be shown to The Killer, *Distortion* activates and a token is consumed.

  For the next **[[6/8/10]] seconds** while *Distortion* is activated, you do not leave scratch
  marks and your aura will not be shown to The Killer.
  - *Distortion* does not activate when you are in the dying state or in a trap.

  Sketch inspired by a few sleepless nights during winter. Exploration of Norse mythology: bravery
  can conceal your flaws, even when you are at your most vulnerable. -Jeff, pencil on toned paper,
