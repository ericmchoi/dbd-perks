  You seek retribution on those who have wronged you.

  A Survivor who blinds you or stuns you using a pallet or locker becomes your Obsession.

  Anytime a new Survivor becomes the Obsession, they are affected by the
  {{status:oblivious|Oblivious}} status effect for **[[40/50/60]] seconds** and their aura is shown
  to you for **4 seconds**.

  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
