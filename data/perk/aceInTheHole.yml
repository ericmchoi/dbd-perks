  Lady Luck always seems to be throwing something good your way.

  When retrieving an item from a chest, there is a **100%** chance that a **very rare** (or lower)
  add-on will be attached to it.
  **[[10/25/50]]%** chance of finding an add-on of **uncommon** rarity or lower.

  When escaping, keep any addons your item has.
