description: |-
  A Hex that affects all Survivors' generator repair progress.
  
  All generators are affected by *Hex: Ruin*. While a generator is not being repaired by a Survivor,
  it will immediately and automatically regress repair progress at **[[100/150/200]]%** of the
  normal regression speed.

  *The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing.*

  "A curse is upon you. It will be your ruin."
