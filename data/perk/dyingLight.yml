  You become __obsessed__ with one Survivor.

  Your obsession gains a **33%** action speed bonus to unhooking and healing other Survivors.

  Each time you hook a Survivor other than the Obsession, if the Obsession is alive, gain a token.
  If the Obsession is alive, all Survivors who are not the Obsession get **[[2/2.5/3]]%** penalty to
  Repair, Healing, and Sabotage speeds for each token.
  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
