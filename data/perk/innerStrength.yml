  You look inward and trust your instincts when you feel lost and alone.

  Each time you complete a totem cleanse action, *Inner Strength* activates. If you are already
  afflicted by the {{status:broken|Broken}} status effect, *Inner Strength* does not activate.

  While *Inner Strength* is active, hiding inside a locker for **[[10/9/8]] seconds** while injured
  automatically heals you from injured to healthy.

  *Inner Strength* becomes deactivated as soon as it has successfully triggered.
