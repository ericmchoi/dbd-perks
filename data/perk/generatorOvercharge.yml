  You are fuelled by your hate for progress.

  Overcharge a generator by performing the __Damage Generator__ action. The next Survivor
  interacting with that generator is faced with a **tremendously** difficult Skill Check. Failing
  the Skill Check results in an additional **[[3/4/5]]%** generator regression.

  Succeeding the Skill Check grants no progress but prevents the generator explosion.
