  You become __obsessed__ with one Survivor.

  After hooking the Obsession, *Dead Man's Switch* activates for the next **[[35/40/45]] seconds**.

  While activated, any Survivor that stops repairing a generator before it is fully repaired causes
  The Entity to block the generator until *Dead Man's Switch's* effect ends.

  Affected generators are highlighted by a white aura.

  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
