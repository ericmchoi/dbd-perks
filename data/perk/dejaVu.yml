  Unlocks potential in one's aura reading ability. Paranoia paired with the horror for failure
  drives you to avoid repeating the same mistakes.
  The auras of **3** generators which are in close proximity to one another are revealed to you for
  **[[30/45/60]] seconds**, at the start of the match and each time a generator is completed. If you
  are holding a map that can track generators, generators revealed by *Deja Vu* are added to the
  map.
