  When your mind is set, there better be no one standing in your way.

  While standing in a locker for **3 seconds**, *Head On* activates.

  While *Head On* is activated, perform a rush action to leave a locker to use *Head On*. If The
  Killer is standing within *Head On's* effective range, The Killer is stunned for **3 seconds**.

  Causes the {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}} status effect for **[[60/50/40]] seconds**.

  Head On cannot be used while {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}}.

  You do not recover from the {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}} status effect while running.

  *Head On* cannot be used when you have idle crows.
