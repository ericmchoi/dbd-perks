  Your agility is incomparable.

  After falling from a height, cat-like reflexes reduce your stagger duration from falling by
  **75%** and reduce the volume of grunts from falling by **100%**. You start sprinting at **150%**
  your normal running speed for a maximum of **3 seconds**.

  Causes the {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}} status effect for **[[60/50/40]]** seconds.

  *Balanced Landing* cannot be used while {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}}.

  You do not recover from the {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}} status effect while running.
