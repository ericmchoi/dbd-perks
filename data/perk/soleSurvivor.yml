  As more of your friends fall to the killer, you become shrouded in isolation and the killer's
  __aura reading abilities__ towards you are disrupted.

  Every time a fellow Survivor is killed or sacrificed, gain a token. For each token, your aura
  cannot be read by The Killer within a max range of **[[20/22/24]] meters** for each **killed** or
  **sacrificed** Survivor.
  - *Increases your chances of being The Killer's Obsession.*
  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
