  Getting close to the Killer fills you with determination.

  For each **15 seconds** you are standing within the Killer Terror Radius and not in a chase, you
  gain a Token up to a maximum of **[[2/3/4]] Tokens**.

  When *Stake Out* has at least *1 Token*, Good Skill Checks are considered Great Skill Checks,
  consume *1 Token*, and grant an additional **1%** bonus to Generator repair progress.

  "I had you, I had you on your knees. You're runnin' scared because we had you. We're gonna close
