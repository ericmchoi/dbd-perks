  You start the trial with a **-25%** progress penalty for Skill Checks to heal Survivors.

  For every successful Skill Check while healing a Survivor, you receive a Token up to a maximum of
  **[[3/4/5]] Tokens**.

  Each Token grants you a **+15%** progress bonus.

  Great Skill Checks cannot be performed while using Autodidact.
  - Autodidact is not active when using a Med Kit to heal.
