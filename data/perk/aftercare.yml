  Unlocks potential in one's aura-reading ability.

  You see the aura of every Survivor that:
  - You rescue from a hook, or rescues you from a hook.
  - You complete a healing action on, or completes a healing action on you.

  They also see your aura.

  This occurs for up to **[[1/2/3]] Survivors**. All effects for *Aftercare* are reset when you are
  hooked by The Killer.

  Oil work to honor my best buddies who happen to be the best musicians I know. Their first album is
  still my favorite. It got me through a dark time in my life. -Jeff, oil on canvas, 16x16
