description: |-
  A Hex rooting its power on hope. You are animated by the power of your Hex Totem when the
  Survivors are on the verge of escaping.

  Once the Exit Gates are powered, if there is a Dull Totem remaining on the map, this Hex is
  applied to it.

  While this Hex is active,
  - Survivors suffer from the {{status:exposed|Exposed}} status effect.
  - Your movement speed is increased by **[[2/3/4]]%**.
  
  *The Hex effects persist as long as the related Hex Totem is standing.*
flavor: |-
  "And the beast became faster and more powerful as if The Entity's shadowy whips were lashing at
  its back."
