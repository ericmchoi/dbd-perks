  You become __obsessed__ with one Survivor.

  Each time a generator is completed, your Obsession (a Survivor) sees your aura for **[[5/4/3]]
  seconds.** Each time a generator is completed, all Survivors' locations are revealed to you for
  **3 seconds**. Once all generators are completed, the Obsession has the {{status:exposed|Exposed}}
  status effect and you can **kill** your obsession.
  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
