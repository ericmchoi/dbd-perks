  Evil has a way of always finding you.

  After you earn **3** Protection Hit scoring events, *Mettle of Man* activates.

  Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the __dying state__ from the
  __injured state__ is ignored.

  The next time you heal back to full health, your aura will be revealed to the killer when you are
  further than **[[12/14/16]] meters** from the killer.

  *Mettle of Man* will deactivate the next time you are put into the dying state.
  - *Increases your chances of being The Killer's Obsession.*
  - *The Killer can only be __obsessed__ with one Survivor at a time.*
