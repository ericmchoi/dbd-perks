  A deep bond with The Entity unlocks great strength.

  After Hooking a Survivor, the next generator you break is instantly regressed by **25%** of its
  total progress. Normal generation regression applies after the damage is done. *Pop Goes the
  Weasel* is active **[[40/50/60]] seconds** after the Survivor is hooked.
