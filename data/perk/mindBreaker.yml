  Your distressing presence drains and weakens your prey.

  While repairing generators with less than **50%** repair progression, Survivors are afflicted by

  Any existing {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}} status effect timers are paused while the Survivor is
  repairing a Generator. After ending the repair action, the Survivor is afflicted by the
  {{status:exhausted|Exhausted}} status effect for **[[1/2/3]] second(s)**.
